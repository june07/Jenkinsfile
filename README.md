# sublime-Jenkinsfile

Jenkinsfile is a plugin for Sublime Text that gives you easy access to the Jenkins declarative-linter via a secure mechanism, SSH or HTTPS.

[https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jenkinsfile](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jenkinsfile)

  - Securely (ssh, https) lint your Jenkinsfile ([What is a Jenkinsfile?](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/)) inside of Sublime Text
  - Lint against Jenkins cloud instance if ssh access is unavailble on your primary environment
  - Magic

Jenkins includes Pipeline Development Tools as shown on [Jenkins.io][jenkins.io linter]...
> Jenkins can validate, or "lint", a Declarative Pipeline from the command line before actually running it.
> This can be done using a Jenkins CLI command or by making an HTTP POST request with appropriate parameters.
> We **recommended using the SSH interface** to run the linter.
> See the Jenkins CLI documentation for details on how to properly configure Jenkins for secure command-line access.


## Technology

* [Sublime Text] - obviously

Jenkinsfile uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Python] - a programming language changes the world
* [SSH] - a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network

And of course Jenkinsfile itself is open source with a [public Git repository][jenkinsfilegh] on GitHub.

## How to install

With Package Control:
1. First step is done with Package Control or manually

    - **With Package Control**
    Run “Package Control: Install Package” command, find and install Jenkinsfile plugin.

    - **Manually** *(without Package Control)*:
    Clone or download from [git][jenkinsfilegh] into your packages folder (in ST, find Browse Packages (in ST4 it's under Preferences)… menu item to open this folder).
    note: You must clone or download into a directory named "Jenkinsfile" and not sublime-Jenkinsfile.

2.  Restart Sublime Text (if required)

## Setup

~~Currently you must use Pageant (Windows) to create a session that can authenticate via ssh to your Jenkins host.~~<br>
You can now use this plugin via two methods either via Pageant on Windows or via plain SSH.

1. Using via SSH (Linux, OSX, or Windows):
   * Set the `jenkins_ssh_user` (default admin), `jenkins_ssh_host` (default localhost), and `jenkins_ssh_port` (default 22) configuration values to match that of your Jenkins server.<br><br>
   * Note: On Windows you must clear the pageant_session configuration variable to use SSH.
2. Or for a Pageant setup on Windows:
   * The name of the session must match the configured value of `pageant_session` (default is "jenkins") as shown:

## Usage

Now whenever you have are editing a Jenkinsfile (filename needs to include Jenkinsfile) and save the file, the plugin will invoke the remote instance of the Jenkins declarative-linter... either configured via SSH credentials or a hosted Jenkins declarative-linter HTTPS endpoint such as `https://api.brakecode.com/api/v1/jenkinsfile`.

### Hosted Jenkins Declarative Linter Enpoint

Given a configuration file with the following included:

```
"jenkins_http_endpoint": "https://api.brakecode.com/api/v1/jenkinsfile"
```

you will have access to the [BrakeCODE](https://brakecode.com) hosted endpoint of the Jenkins declarative linter and be able to use a limited amount of free API calls.

By default this endpoint is not configured. The server resources are entirely owned by the author of this plugin, however as your Jenkinsfile will be sent (**securely**) to infrastructure outside of your control, it was thought best to leave this as a feature which required clear user intent and configuration. Currently, no analytics or other data collection is done.

The file can also be linted without saving by using the keyboard shortcut (cntl-alt-j by default)
